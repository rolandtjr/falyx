**Falyx** is a battle-ready, introspectable CLI framework for building resilient, asynchronous workflows with:

- ‚úÖ Modular action chaining and rollback
- üîÅ Built-in retry handling
- ‚öôÔ∏è Full lifecycle hooks (before, after, success, error, teardown)
- üìä Execution tracing, logging, and introspection
- üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Async-first design with Process support
- üß© Extensible CLI menus and customizable output

> Built for developers who value *clarity*, *resilience*, and *visibility* in their terminal workflows.

## ‚ú® Why Falyx?

Modern CLI tools deserve the same resilience as production systems. Falyx makes it easy to:

- Compose workflows using `Action`, `ChainedAction`, or `ActionGroup`
- Inject the result of one step into the next (`last_result`)
- Handle flaky operations with retries and exponential backoff
- Roll back safely on failure with structured undo logic
- Add observability with execution timing, result tracking, and hooks
- Run in both interactive *and* headless (scriptable) modes
- Customize output with Rich `Table`s (grouping, theming, etc.)

## üîß Installation

```bash
pip install falyx
```

> Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rolandtjr/falyx.git
cd falyx
poetry install
```

---

## ‚ö° Quick Example

```python
import asyncio
import random

from falyx import Falyx, Action, ChainedAction

# A flaky async step that fails randomly
async def flaky_step():
    await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
    if random.random() < 0.5:
        raise RuntimeError("Random failure!")
    return "ok"

# Create the actions
step1 = Action(name="step_1", action=flaky_step, retry=True)
step2 = Action(name="step_2", action=flaky_step, retry=True)

# Chain the actions
chain = ChainedAction(name="my_pipeline", actions=[step1, step2])

# Create the CLI menu
falyx = Falyx("üöÄ Falyx Demo")
falyx.add_command(
    key="R",
    description="Run My Pipeline",
    action=chain,
    logging_hooks=True,
    preview_before_confirm=True,
    confirm=True,
)

# Entry point
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(falyx.run())
```

```bash
‚ùØ python simple.py
                                üöÄ Falyx Demo

  [R] Run My Pipeline
  [Y] History                                         [Q] Exit

>
```

```bash
‚ùØ python simple.py run R
Command: 'R' ‚Äî Run My Pipeline
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚õì ChainedAction 'my_pipeline'
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚öô Action 'step_1'
    ‚îÇ   ‚Üª Retries: 3x, delay 1.0s, backoff 2.0x
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚öô Action 'step_2'
        ‚Üª Retries: 3x, delay 1.0s, backoff 2.0x
Confirm execution of R ‚Äî Run My Pipeline (calls `my_pipeline`)  [Y/n] y
[2025-04-15 22:03:57] WARNING   ‚ö†Ô∏è Retry attempt 1/3 failed due to 'Random failure!'.
‚úÖ Result: ['ok', 'ok']
```

### üß± Core Building Blocks

#### `Action`
A single async unit of work. Painless retry support.

#### `ChainedAction`
Run tasks in sequence. Supports rollback on failure and context propagation.

#### `ActionGroup`
Run tasks in parallel. Useful for fan-out operations like batch API calls.

#### `ProcessAction`
Offload CPU-bound work to another process ‚Äî no extra code needed.

#### `Falyx`
Your CLI controller ‚Äî powers menus, subcommands, history, bottom bars, and more.

#### `ExecutionContext`
Tracks metadata, arguments, timing, and results for each action execution.

#### `HookManager`
Registers and triggers lifecycle hooks (`before`, `after`, `on_error`, etc.) for actions and commands.

## üß† Design Philosophy

> ‚ÄúLike a phalanx: organized, resilient, and reliable.‚Äù

Falyx is designed for developers who don‚Äôt just want CLI tools to run ‚Äî they want them to **fail meaningfully**, **recover gracefully**, and **log clearly**.
